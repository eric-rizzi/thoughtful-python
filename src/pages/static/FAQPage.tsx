      <h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>

      <section className={styles.section}>
        <h2>Getting Started</h2>

        <div className={styles.faqItem}>
          <h3>Do I need to create an account to use Thoughtful Python?</h3>
          <p>
            No! You can use Thoughtful Python completely anonymously. Your
            progress will be saved locally in your browser. However, if you want
            to sync your progress across devices or access your learning history
            from multiple computers, you can sign in with your Google account.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div className={styles.faqItem}>
          <h3>Do I need to install Python on my computer?</h3>
          <p>
            No installation is required! Thoughtful Python runs entirely in your
            browser using Pyodide, a Python interpreter compiled to WebAssembly.
            This means you can start coding immediately without any setup.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div className={styles.faqItem}>
          <h3>What if I lose my progress?</h3>
          <p>
            For anonymous users, progress is stored in your browser's local
            storage. Clearing your browser data will delete your progress. For
            authenticated users, progress is synced to our servers and will be
            restored when you sign in again.
          </p>

        <h2>Learning Features</h2>

        <div className={styles.faqItem}>
          <h3>What types of exercises are available?</h3>
          <p>Thoughtful Python offers several types of learning activities:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>

              <strong>Prediction sections:</strong> Predict code output before
              running
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>PRIMM activities:</strong> Predict, Run, Investigate,
              Modify, Make with AI feedback
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Reflection activities:</strong> Free-form coding with AI
              evaluation
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Quizzes:</strong> Multiple choice, matching, and selection
              questions
            </li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <div className={styles.faqItem}>
          <h3>How does the AI feedback work?</h3>
          <p>
            For PRIMM and Reflection sections, we use AI to evaluate your code
            submissions and provide personalized feedback. The AI checks if your
            code meets the requirements and offers suggestions for improvement.
            However, AI feedback should be considered as guidance - always
            verify with your instructor if you're unsure.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div className={styles.faqItem}>
          <h3>Can I skip lessons or sections?</h3>
          <p>
            Yes, you can navigate to any lesson at any time. However, we
            recommend following the curriculum in order, as later lessons build
            on concepts from earlier ones. Some sections are marked as required
            for completion tracking.

        <h2>Technical Issues</h2>

        <div className={styles.faqItem}>
          <h3>The platform is running slowly. What can I do?</h3>
          <p>
            Pyodide loads the Python interpreter when you first visit the site,
            which may take a moment. Once loaded, performance should improve.
            For best results, use a modern browser like Chrome, Firefox, or Edge
            with JavaScript enabled.
          </p>

        <div className={styles.faqItem}>
          <h3>My code won't run. What's wrong?</h3>
          <p>Common issues include:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Syntax errors in your code - check the error message</li>
            <li>
              The Python environment is still loading - wait for the green
              indicator
            </li>
            <li>Browser compatibility - try a different browser</li>
            <li>JavaScript is disabled - enable it in your browser settings</li>
