Or think about movie theater discounts: you get a discount if you're a student OR a senior citizen.\n\nThat's where **boolean operators** come in. They let you combine conditions:\n- `and`: BOTH conditions must be True\n- `or`: AT LEAST ONE condition must be True\n- `not`: Flips True to False (and False to True)\n\nThese operators let your functions make complex decisions based on multiple factors.",
