Now it's time to combine these superpowers!\n\nThink about the polygon pattern from Lesson 1. You discovered that any regular shape uses the angle 360÷sides. But you had to manually create different loops for triangles, squares, and pentagons. What if one function could draw ANY polygon?\n\nThat's what we'll build today: functions that use loops intelligently.
