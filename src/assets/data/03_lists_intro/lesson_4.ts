      content:
        '`Python` was created by _Guido van Rossum_ and first released in 1991. Its clean syntax, which uses indentation rather than braces to define code blocks, makes it particularly accessible for beginners who can focus on learning programming concepts without getting distracted by complex syntax. Python has become popular for learning due to its readability. The language\'s philosophy of "there should be one—and preferably only one—obvious way to do it" creates a straightforward learning path that helps beginners develop good programming habits from the start.',

        "When `answer` is 'c', the outer `if` is false, so the outer `else` block executes. Inside that, the inner `if answer == \"b\"` is also false, so its `else` block runs, printing 'Other'. Finally, the 'All done' print statement outside all conditionals always runs.",
