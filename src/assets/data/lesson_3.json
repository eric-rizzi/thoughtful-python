If the first condition fails, it checks if b is greater than or equal to both a and c. If true, it returns b.\n3. If neither condition is true, it returns c.\n\nThis function has some interesting edge cases. What happens when two or all three numbers are equal? The function will return the first number in the comparison that satisfies the condition."
