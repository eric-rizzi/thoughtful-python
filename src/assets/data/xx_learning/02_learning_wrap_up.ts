These aren't random activities; they're built on well-researched best practices for learning complex skills. Understanding these practices will not only help you get the most out of this site, but will help you learn pretty much anything more effectively. The core techniques for learning are: _spaced-practice_, _interleaving_, _retrieval-practice_, _elaboration_, _concrete examples_, and _dual coding_.\n\nEach of these techniques are a way of exercising your brain and creating complex webs of connections that improve your understanding.

It's a bit like the gym: you can go and do every exercise in a single day, but you'll get much better results if you make a habit of going.\n\nBased on this explanation what do you think is the optimal strategy for approaching this website?",
