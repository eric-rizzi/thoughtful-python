For this reason, this website takes a very opinionated approach to learning by using a method called PRIMM. PRIMM is based on the realization that people often struggle to learn programming because writing a program from scratch involves **a lot** of things happening at once. For novices, handling all the necessary details can quickly become overwhelming.\n\nPRIMM (which stands for Predict, Run, Investigate, Modify, Make) is a way of learning to program that mimics how real engineers work. Very rarely do engineers create something from scratch. Instead, they start with something that's close and then slowly mold it to be what they want.",
