            'Reflecting on things that you struggled with and then forcing yourself to articulate **why** you struggled is an incredibly powerful learning tool. This form of "journaling" can then act as a record of everything you\'ve learned in case you get stuck sometime later. These types of journals are considered best practice for anyone who takes their learning seriously: think of a scientist\'s notebook or a writer\'s journal.\n\nAs with PRIMM, AI has the potential to super-charge reflection. This is because it can provide quick feedback on mistakes. In addition, it can provide a "speed bump" to make you slow down and take the reflection seriously. Below is an example reflection section. You complete it by:\n1. Choosing the topic (since it\'s the first time, we\'ve set it to `How Print Works`)\n2. Creating a small code example (also set)\n3. Explaining how the code works\n4. Asking the AI if there is any room for improvement\n\nThe section forces you to iterate with AI to improve your code/analysis until you demonstrate deep understanding. Basically, you aren\'t "allowed" to submit and finish the section until the AI gives you at least a "mostly understands" on a scale of poor, developing, mostly, and fully. Annoying? A bit! Effective? Definitely! Try it out below.',

What is basically happening is the website sends your entire journal entry to a ChatBot and asks it to assess it using a rubric designed for people learning to program. The AI is also prompted to provide constructive feedback when there is some sort of misunderstanding.\n\nThe best way to approach reflection sections is to pretend you are writing for some future version of yourself who doesn\'t quite remember a topic. Keep the entries short and to the point. Using the magic phrase **"as seen in the example above"** will really help because it will keep your analysis rooted to your code.',
