However, there's something we carefully avoided talking about: printing integers and strings together on the same line.\n\nFor example, if you have a variable age that holds the integer 15 (`age = 15`), we've only shown you how to print `age` by itself. We haven't shown you how to print something like `You are 15 years old` where the integer is combined with a string. In this lesson, we'll show you different ways to try and do this and how to debug any errors you encounter along the way.",
