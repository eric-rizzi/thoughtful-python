Now you understand that `range()` is also a function - one that returns a sequence of numbers for your loops to use. You've created your own functions with `def`, given them input parameters, and filled them with loops that repeat, nest, and vary.\n\nYou've mastered indentation - not just as a style choice, but as Python's way of showing what's 'inside' functions and loops. You've seen the errors that occur when indentation is wrong, and learned to read error messages to quickly fix problems.\n\nThis final lesson brings it ALL together: strings, integers, variables, functions, loops, libraries, and debugging.
