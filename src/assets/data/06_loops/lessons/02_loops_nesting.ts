For example, what if you want to draw eight squares arranged in a circle, or five triangles in a row?\n\nWhenever there's a repeating pattern of patterns, you should think of using **nested loops**. A nested loop is simply a loop inside another loop. The inner loop completes ALL its repetitions before the outer loop continues to its next repetition.
